    <!-- action post will return to same page with variable user inputs -->

    <form method="post">
        <label for="first">First Number:</label>
        <input type="number" name="first" id="first" value="" required>

        <!-- I changed from a input to button so that I could post the sumbit value
        after button was pressed, this allowed $_POST['sumbit'] to set a value
        other than NULL, allowed the IF statement to proceed -->

    </form>

    <?php

    /* I needed something to block the undefined variables below in the IF statement,
    they are unknown until the user submits the numbers. I had to find something that
    would show as undefined to stop the IF statement from action, I found in my search
    ISSET â€” Determine if a variable is declared and is different than null. Tried it
    out and it worked. Since $_POST['sumbit'] has not been set the IF statement as NULL,
    I was asking if not null, proceed.
